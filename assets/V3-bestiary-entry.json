    "name": "V3",
    "type": "SUPREME MACHINE",
    "description": "After the final war, a third model was hastily created to rebuild the destroyed cities. To conserve resources, most of which had been expended during the war, this model was based on V1 and produced in the same factories. As a result, it shares the same exterior plating as V1 and is capable of refueling through contact with blood.\n\nIn order to accelerate the rebuilding process, these models were equipped with grappling hooks and a powerful artificial intelligence that leans heavily towards cooperation. This AI communicates with other instances of the same model through internal channels, thereby enhancing productivity and coherence.\n\nDespite the V3 model's original non-military purpose, it might appear to be a less formidable adversary. However, they are well aware of this fact. Therefore, unlike other machines, they consistently move in pairs and sometimes even in large flocks.",
    "strategy": "- Their movements and combat tactics can be confusing or unpredictable; it is recommended to counteract this by employing your own erratic maneuvers.\n\n- Similar to you, they possess the ability to replenish their health by absorbing the blood of enemies or even yours. Maintaining a considerable distance is strongly recommended to thwart their self-healing.\n\n- Occasionally, they engage in healing each other when outside active combat, exchanging blood. Utilize this opportunity to launch an attack.\n\n- Attempting to fight multiple at once is futile. Instead, concentrate your efforts on one target at a time as to not become overwhelmed."
